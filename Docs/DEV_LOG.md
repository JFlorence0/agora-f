## February 2, 2025 - Project Initialization  

### What I Did  
- Created the **Agora Frontend** project using **SwiftUI**.  
- Removed default navigation and list components.   
- Committed the initial project setup to GitHub.  

### Why I Chose Swift  
- **Pushing myself as a developer:** I’m comfortable in React Native, so I intentionally chose Swift for the frontend and Java for the backend to step outside my comfort zone.  
- **Slower development at first, faster in the long run:** Learning SwiftUI will take time initially, but mastering it will improve my ability to work across multiple tech stacks.  
- **Native code:** I've read that performance is better and that there's more flexibilty in using native code and would like to see the difference.

## Next Steps  
1. **Call the backend API** and fetch data.  
2. **Display the data** on the Home Screen.  
3. **Figure out the app’s flow**, but prioritize getting the backend fully functional first.
